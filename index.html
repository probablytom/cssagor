	<a href="http://projectalbert.net" class="descriptor">Project Albert</a>
	<ul>
		<li>A project for simplifying improvising stories using software engineering techniques, particularly childrens' bedtime stories. <br/>A proof of concept of using design patterns to bridge lessons we learn from science and arts, which is still under development.</li>
	</ul>

	<a href="http://github.com/probablytom/music-organiser" class="descriptor">Music Organiser</a>
	<ul>
		<li>A script to fix the shortcomings I found in a solution to a similar problem <a href="https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts/blob/master/python2.7/music-organizer.py">by @bamos on GitHub</a>. <br/>Organises music based on a handful of tags, by searching files for metadata, and produces a filesystem structure defined by the user.<br/><br/>For example, you might want your music library reorganised so that tracks which are numbered are put into albums, which are put into folders for each artist, which are then sorted by genre. The parameter --struture=genre/artist/album/track+title would do the trick.<br/>This is still under active development. Feel free to contribute!</li>
