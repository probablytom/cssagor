	<li>
		<p class="descriptor">4th Year University Student</p>
		<ul><li>I'm a student in my 4th year of Computer Science at Glasgow University.</br>My classes include Artificial Intelligence, Constraint Programming, Cyber Security and my fourth year of Algorithmics.</br>I'm studying an MSci programme, and graduate with a 2/1 or 1st in 2017.</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p class="descriptor">Lab Demonstrator</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I demonstrate lab sessions for team projects (practical professional software development) and Java and object oriented programming sessions.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p class="descriptor">High school teaching assistant</p>
		<ul><li>As a part of my studies, I spend time teaching in a local high school, mostly with National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher classes.</br>In the school, I act as a classroom assistant and give talks and workshops on different programming and computer science fundamentals.</li></ul>

		<ul><li>A still-developed offshoot from my honours dissertation. This is a library for introucing faults into sociotechnical models. </li>
			<li>This model is composed of two parts: 
				<ul>
					<li>A sociotechnical modelling system, in raw python, that focuses on workflows in a pragmatic way</li>
					<li>A mutation library that intercepts python function execution, recompiles the source code with safe and infinitely powerful alterations, and executes a slightly altered version of the mutant.<br/>This has the effect of running a different version of a function every time the funtion is executed, something I haven't found in any other mutation library.</li>
				</ul>

				</li>
				<li>This is still under active development, with <a href="http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~tws/">Tim Storer</a> at Glagow university. We're finishing up a paper on what's been done so far, and it'll be submitted to conferences soon. Watch this space!</li>

<ul>
	<li>
	<a href="http://projectalbert.net" class="descriptor">Project Albert</a>
	<ul>
		<li>A project for simplifying improvising stories using software engineering techniques, particularly childrens' bedtime stories. <br/>A proof of concept of using design patterns to bridge lessons we learn from science and arts, which is still under development.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<a href="http://github.com/probablytom/music-organiser" class="descriptor">Music Organiser</a>
	<ul>
		<li>A script to fix the shortcomings I found in a solution to a similar problem <a href="https://github.com/bamos/python-scripts/blob/master/python2.7/music-organizer.py">by @bamos on GitHub</a>. <br/>Organises music based on a handful of tags, by searching files for metadata, and produces a filesystem structure defined by the user.<br/><br/>For example, you might want your music library reorganised so that tracks which are numbered are put into albums, which are put into folders for each artist, which are then sorted by genre. The parameter --struture=genre/artist/album/track+title would do the trick.<br/>This is still under active development. Feel free to contribute!</li>
