		<h1>Tom Wallis: Hiring</h1>
		<h2>Why hire Tom?</h2>
		<p class="category">Interests</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<p class="descriptor">Functional programming</p>
			<ul><li>Functional programming is of interest to me because it permits beautiful solutions to problems that are otherwise almost impossible to get one's head around. <br/>Regular procedural programming was born out of assembly code and C; it's for very precice control over the actions of the computer, which lends itself to both great efficiency and big mistakes. Functional programming, born out of lambda expressions and Lisp, are mathematically oriented and describe an algorithm from a very high level. The benefit of this is twofold:</li>
				<li><ol>
					<li>Functions can be composed for crazy safety, so type errors and the like can be avoided by design.</li>
					<li>Programming is much easier when you can describe a solution and define parts of the solution in more and more detail; when enough detail is given, the standard libraries and language itself can take over. Then, all you need to do is describe how you want a problem solved, and the language does the hard work!</li>
				</ol></li>
				<li>This isn't to say that functional programming is <i>better</i> than procedural programming, different tools are needed for different jobs. However, functional programming is often overlooked, making programs buggier and programmers' lives harder. I'm very interested in functional programming!</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p class="descriptor">Productivity</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Personal productivity is endlessly fascinating to me. THe workflows and procedures people go through to make themselves more productive are usually founded in their own experience, but learning from each other is hard, because every person works differently. </li>
				<li>What makes this harder is that people are very protective of the way they work! Their day-to-day processes are a large part of what makes them them, and suggesting that those processes should be replaced by new ones can be met with some resistance. This results in a lot of people struggling to get things done on time, lose weight, or remember important details at the right time or place.</li>
				<li>I'm really interested in what makes a certain approach good or bad. I'll often experiment with new techniques and ideas on my own day-to-day workflow, often to great success! I've managed to steamline my task and time management as a result, and become a more focused person. (And I'm always happy to share tips! ;) )</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
			<ul>
				<li>
				<p class="descriptor">Design patterns</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<ul>
					<li>I am absolutely fascinated with design patterns. Design patterns are small, condensed descriptions of solutions to problems. The format was first applied by Christopher Alexander to Architecture in his book, "A Pattern Language".</li>
					<li>Design patterns are integral to good software engineering and personal work, but they have applications in many areas. For example, design patterns were applied to parenting, by Merlin Mann, as he describes in his talk, "Toward patterns for creativity".</li>
					<li>While I'm ultimately interested in building a set of patterns for the interaction of information in an organism, I am currently developing a set of desgin patterns for improvisation of childrens' bedtime stories. More can be found on the <a href="http://tomwallis.net/">home page</a>.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>
			<ul>
				<li><p class="descriptor">More Soon</p></li>
				<li>Unfortunately, it's currently exam season and I don't have time to fill this in to completion yet! There's lots more to note here, including languages I'm proficient in, academic and non-academic projects, (soon-to-be-)published academic work and my interests outside of work, like philosophy and cinematography. I'm also yet to add internships and work over my summers at university. If you'd like to hear more, please email me on hearmore-AT-tomwallis-DOT-net!</li>
